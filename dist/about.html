            Throughout my time as a software engineer, my goal has always been
            to deliver fully-functional and visually compelling products, that
            remain easy to use and understand. My career has given me the
            opportunity to reach this goal through a number of languages,
            technologies, and frameworks, and I continue to learn new ways to
            convey my passion.
